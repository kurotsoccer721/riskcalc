# Risk estimation for Self-Driving using Fuzzy logic & Genetic algorythm

This repository is memorandum of my graduation research.<br>
<br>
fuzzyfunc.py: includes functions used for fuzzy assumption and self-driving simulation<br>
GAjuppy.py: for making optimized parameters using GA<br>
avoid_test.py: for simulating self-driving on Unity<br>
Controller.cs: script of driver(Unity's object)
